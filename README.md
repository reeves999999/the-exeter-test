# The Exeter Test App for GitHub Commit Lookups

### Note - far from complete

## You can run locally or see in action at Vercel here:

https://the-exeter-test.vercel.app/

## Tools used

- React 18
- React Router 6
- React Query (caching, retries, initial data etc.)
- Typescript
- Vite
- Tailwind
- Vitest
- Testing Library
- useState, useContext, custom hooks, API service

## Use reeves999999/the-exeter-test for working example

## Due to unauthorised usage limits, GitHub restricts hits to the API to 60 per hour. I have reduced the useQuery retry count accordingly.

## Incompleted tasks

- Further consolidation, abstractions and tidy up
- E2E testing
- Misc. UI/UX improvements
- Extented tests
- Add/improve loading and error states

## Hopefully enough here to demonstrate knowledge at least.
